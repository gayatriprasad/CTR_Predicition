# CTR_Predicition
Predict the Click-Through Rate 

The dataset is from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avazu-ctr-prediction

Description

In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding.

For this competition, we have provided 11 days worth of Avazu data to build and test prediction models. Can you find a strategy that beats standard classification algorithms? The winning models from this competition will be released under an open-source license.

The idea is to solve the challenge and predict if the click happens or not. 

I used multiple models and their variants for the analysis.
